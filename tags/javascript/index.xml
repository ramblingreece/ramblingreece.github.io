      <description>&lt;p&gt;The documentation for Dynamics Portals currently only has an example for adding custom validation to the submit button on a form if you are adding that to a step in a Web Form, but what if you want to add validation to the button on an Entity Form? Read on to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show, very quickly, a set of tools and process that is working well for me while developing client side apps for Dynamics 365. This is just one way but some of the tools and how I use them should be something you can take away and implement in whatever you do for you development of Web Resources within the CRM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hidden does not mean secure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever had to customise an entity form in Dynamics 365 then you will likely have hidden a field, marked a field as business required and possibly even made a field read-only. Did you know however that all of these can be reverse by most users? Just because the field is not visible on the form does not mean the user cannot find the value or edit it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have worked with Portals in Dynamics 365 then you will have come across the generic error and very unhelpful text below. The latest version allows you to access this log now but where is it and why can I not find this on the Microsoft Docs site? Read on to find out more.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true, the title of this post is a little odd. But then, the history of JavaScript is too. Recently I have been trying to get a better understanding of the web technologies out there and how I can use them within the CRM or standalone projects. This has inevitably led me to the realisation that I am woefully out of date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
