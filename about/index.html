            <p>I am a curious person by nature and have a built in desire to find out how things work. This means I ask a lot of questions and like to experiment. When I was younger I took all of my toys apart to try and understand how they operated; sometimes I even put them back together! With this blog I aim to mostly write about what I do professionally which is Power Platform / Dynamics consultancy and development.</p>
<p>I have worked with Dynamics since version 4.0 progressing through a variety of roles starting with business intelligence, falling into technical support then progressing up to development and most recently spending lots of time in consultancy and technical leadership.</p>
<p>These days I am most excited by the whole Power Platform and DevOps for delivery.</p>
